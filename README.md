Unex is a student financial planner that enables easy and simple management of income and expenses. Users can visualize their monthly 
spending and income, along with summaries of top categories. They can also easily add, remove, and update individual expenditures to keep 
up to date information. 

Users will need to sign in/sign up to access their information. 

The project is built using MongoDB, Express, React, Express, and TypeScript. Additional tools such as Axios, and libraries for better
visualizations (react-simple-charts for example) are employed.

The database is hosted on MongoAtlas. 

The Client Folder contains all front-end components, whereas the Server Folder contains the backend handling (Express + Mongoose). 
Running npm run start will launch client, and npm run dev will launch server. To actually use it more freely it is recommended to use 
your own MongoAtlas account as the account used in my case is my own and is restricted.
